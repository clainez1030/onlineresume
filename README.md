# onlineresume
Hi everyone, I am currently taking an online course in full-stack web development and one of the projects was to create an online resume using HTML. I am slowly updating my resume as I learn more (i.e. now including some CSS styling I've learned). It is pretty basic but I hope you enjoy it!
